# fmsg Standards

fmsg itself only describes host-to-host communication â€“ leaving other functionality such as retrival of messages, user identity and access management, undefined. So a full fmsg setup includes other components which would vary between deployments. For instance an enterprise Identity and Access Mangement (IAM) could be integrated on one host, and a custom user management system on another host.

This page documents some common standards surrounding fmsg allowing [implementations](IMPLEMENTATIONS.md) to interoperate.
