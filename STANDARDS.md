# fmsg Standards

fmsg itself only describes host-to-host communication â€“ leaving other functionality such as retrival of messages, user identity and access management, undefined. So a full fmsg setup includes other components which would vary between deployments and use-case. For instance an enterprise Identity and Access Mangement (IAM) could be integrated on one host, and a custom user management system on another host.

This page documents some common standards for services augmenting a fmsg host.

## Naming Convention

Each standard is prefixed with a unique identifer following the format: "FMSG-###", where "###" is a 3 digit number.
