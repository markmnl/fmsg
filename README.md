# msgr

A message protocol and defintion where messages are relational and verfiable by all peers. Messages are sent via a msgr host to one or more recipients. Each message is linked to the previous using a cryptographic hash forming a hierarchical blockchain.

A key motivation for msgr is to replace email keeping the good parts (like the ability to send an unsolicited message directly to an address), cutting out the bad (like inefficency and inconsistancy of clients concatenting email chains in different ways), and, designing for a modern Internet where messages may be between machines or people or combination thereof. The high level objectives of msgr are:

* ownership and control – messages are exchanged at the host level
* verfiable – peers can verify messages are "as written"
* usability – user experiences can utilise the structured hierarchy of messages 
* extensibility – hosts can advertise complementary features avaliable

Overall; msgr aims to be an efficient, secure and extensible messaging system with ownership and control at the host level.
