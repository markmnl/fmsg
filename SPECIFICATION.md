## Terminology

_"fmsg"_ is the name given to the protocol and message definitions described in this document. The name "fmsg" is neither an abbreviation nor acronym, however is thought of as "f-message". The "f" owes its inspiration from popular programming languages such as C's `printf` where the "f" stands for "formatted", "msg" is a common shortening of "message" conveying the meaning while keeping the whole name succinct; "fmsg".


### Terms

_"DNS"_ is for the Domain Name System

_"host"_ is an fmsg implementation which can send and receive fmsg messages to and from other hosts.

_"message"_ refers to an entire message described in [Message](#message) defintion.

_"message header"_ refers to the fields up to and including the attachment headers field in a _message_.

_"thread"_ is a linked heirarchy of messages where messages relate to previous messages using the pid field

_"UTF-8"_ is for the unicode standard: Unicode Transformation Format – 8-bit.


### Message Types

fmsg defines four message types: MESSAGE, CHALLENGE, CHALLENGE RESPONSE and "REJECT or ACCEPT RESPONSE". These structures are aggregates of [Data Types](#data-types) and are described in the [Definition](#definition) section.


### Data Types

Throughout this document the following data types are used. All types are encoded little-endian.

| name       | description                                                                                                          |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| uint8      | 8 bit wide unsigned integer with a value in the set 0 to 255                                                         |
| uint16     | 16 bit wide unsigned integer with a value in the set 0 to 65535                                                      |
| uint32     | 32 bit wide unsigned integer with a value in the set 0 to 4294967295                                                 |
| bit        | single bit 0 or 1 within one of the uint types, the 0 based index of which is defined alongside in this document     |
| float64    | 64 bit wide number in the set of all IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point numbers                                          |
| byte       | a uint8                                                                                                              |
| byte array | sequence of uint8 values the length of which is defined alongside in this document                                   |
| bytes      | a byte array                                                                                                         |
| string     | sequence of characters the length and encoding (e.g. ASCII, UTF-8...) of which is defined alongside in this document |


String lengths are always explicitly defined and null terminating characters are not used. This is a design decision becuase it prevents a class of buffer over-run bugs (search "Heartbleed bug"), simplifies message size calculation, and, inherently limits the length of strings while adding no extra data than a null terminating character would (since all strings lengths here are defined by one uint8).


## Definition

### Message

In programmer friendly JSON a message could look like (once decoded from the binary format defined below):

```JSON
{
    "version": 1,
    "flags": 0
    "pid": null,
    "from": "@markmnl@fmsg.org",
    "to": [
        "@世界@example.com",
        "@chris@fmsg.org"
    ],
    "time": 1654503265.679954,
    "topic": "Hello fmsg!",
    "type": "text/plain;charset=UTF-8",
    "size": 45,
    "data": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "attachments": [
        {
            "size": 1024,
            "filename": "doc.pdf"
        }
    ]
}
```

On the wire messages are encoded thus:

| name                | type                                 | description                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Notes on Message Definition

* Square brackets "[ ]" indicate fields or part thereof may not exist on a message. Where the brackets surround the name, e.g. pid, the whole field my not be present (which in the case of pid is only valid if the message is not a reply). Where they surround part of the type, that part may not be present, e.g. list of attachment headers will not be present if unit8 prefix is 0.
* The topic field is set only on the first message sent in a thread making topic immutable because it cannot be changed by subsequent replies. (Presentations of message threads can of course choose whether to use this or something else).


### Notes on Time

Only one time field is present on a message and this time is stamped by the sending host when it acquired the message. Implementations COULD associate additional data they want with messages, such as the time message was delivered.

fmsg includes some time checking and controls, rejecting messages too far in future or past compared to current time of the receiver, and, checking replies cannot claim to be sent before their parent (See [Reject or Accept Response](#reject-or-accept-response)). Of course this all relies on accuracy of clocks being used, so some leniancy is granted determined by the receiving host. Futhermore, a host may not be reachable for some time so greater leniancy SHOULD be given to messages from the past. Since the time field is stamped by the sending host - one only need concern themselves that their clock is accurate.


### Flags

| bit index | name         | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------:|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0         | has pid      | Set if this message is in reply to another and pid field is present.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1         | common type  | Indicates the type field is just a uint8 value and Media Type can be looked up per [Common MIME Types](#common-mime-types)                                                                                                  |
| 2         | important    | Sender indicates this message is IMPORTANT!                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3         | no reply     | Sender indicates any reply will be discarded.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 4         | no challenge | Sender asks challenge skipped, hosts accepting unsolicited messages SHOULD be cautious accepting this, especially on the wild Internet.                                                                                     |
| 5         | deflate      | Message data is compressed using the zlib structure (defined in RFC 1950), with the deflate compression algorithm (defined in RFC 1951).                                                                                    |
| 6         | keep-alive   | Sender requests connection be kept alive.                                                              |
| 7         | under duress | Sender indicates this message was written under duress.    |


#### Common Media Types

If the common type flag bit is set in the flags field, then type field consists of one uint8 value which maps to the Media Type in the table below. A value not in the table is invalid and the entire message SHOULD be rejected with "invalid" REJECT response. If the common type bit is not set the first uint8 is the length of the subsequent bytes US-ASCII encoded MIME type per RFC 6838. Note even if the common type flag bit is not set (i.e. the Media Type is spelt out in full), the Media Type may be of these "common" types.

For reference the current IANA list of Media Types is located [here](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).

### Attachment

Attachment headers consist of the two fields, filename and size:

| name     | type       | comment                                                                                            |
|----------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| filename | string     | UTF-8 prefixed by unit8 size.                                                                      |
| size     | unit32     | Size of attachment data. unit32 is the max theoretical size, but hosts can/should accept less.     |

filename MUST be:

* UTF-8
* any letter in any language, or any numeric characters
* the hyphen "-" or underscore "_" characters non-consecutively and not at beginning or end
* unique amongst attachments, case-sensitive
* less than 256 bytes length

Attachment data

| name     | type       | comment                                                                                            |
|----------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| data     | byte array | Sequence of octets located after all attachment headers, boundaries of each attachment are defined by corresponding size in attachment header(s) |


### Address

![fmsg address](pics/address.png)

Domain part is the domain name RFC-1035 owning the address. Recipient part identifies the recipient known to hosts for the domain. A leading "@" character is prepended to distinguish from email addresses. The secondary "@" seperates recipient and domain name as per norm.

Recipient part is a string of characters which MUST be:

* UTF-8
* any letter in any language, or any numeric characters
* the hyphen "-" or underscore "_" characters non-consecutively and not at beginning or end
* unique on host using case-insensitive comparison
* less than 256 bytes length when combined with domain name and @ characters 

A whole address is encoded UTF-8 prepended with size:

| name    | type           | comment                                       |
|---------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| address | uint8 + string | UTF-8 encoded string prefixed with uint8 size |


### Challenge

| name        | type     | comment                                                                            |
|-------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| version     | uint8    | MUST be 255 which indicates this messages is a challenge                           |
| header hash | 32 bytes | SHA-256 hash of message header being sent/received up to and including type field. |


### Challenge Response

A challenge response is the next 32 bytes received in reply to challenge request - the existance of which indicates the sender accepted the challenge. This SHA-256 hash SHOULD be kept to ensure the complete message (including attachments) once downloaded matches.

| name     | type          | comment                                                              |
|----------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| msg hash | 32 byte array | SHA-256 hash of entire message body and attachments.                 |


### Reject or Accept Response

A code less than 100 indicates rejection for all recipients and will be the only value. Other codes are per recipient in the same order as the as in the to field of the message excluding recipients for other domains.

| name  | type       | comment                             |
|-------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| codes | byte array | a single or sequence of unit8 codes |


| code | name                  | description                                                             |

| 3    | undisclosed           | no reason is given                                                      |
| 4    | too big               | total size exceeds host's maximum permitted size of messages            |
| 5    | insufficent resources | such as disk space to store the message                                 |

| 7    | past time             | timestamp in the message is too far in the past for this host to accept |
| 8    | future time           | timestamp in message is too far in the future for this host to accept   |
| 9    | time travel           | timestamp in message is before parent timestamp                         |
| 10   | duplicate             | message has already been received                                       |

## Protocol

A message is sent from the sender's host to each unique recipient host (i.e. each domain only once even if multiple recipients with the same domain). Sending a message either wholly succeeds or fails per recipient. During the sending from one host to another several steps are performed depicted in the below flow diagram. 
Two connection-orientated, reliable, in-order and duplex transports are required to perform the full flow. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is an obvious choice, on top of which Transport Layer Security (TLS) may meet your encryption needs.

*Protocol flow diagram*

### Notes

* When challenging, a new connection is opened from the receiving host to the purported sender so the receiving host can verify sending host indeed exists _and_ can prove they are sending this message (in the CHALLENGE, CHALLENGE RESP exchange).
* A host reaching the TERMINATE step SHOULD tear down connection(s) without regard for the other end because they must be either malicious or not following the protocol! 
* Where a message is being sent and connection closed in the diagram, closing only starts after message is sent/received, i.e. not concurrently.
